"","Interviewer"
"1","Steve, I'd like to begin with some biographical information. Tell us about yourself."
"2","Well they might in three hundred years because all this print is going to disintegrate. Tell me a little bit about your parents, your family; what are the earliest things you remember? In 1955, Eisenhower was still President."
"3","So you would have been about five or six years old when John Kennedy was assassinated?"
"4","Where were you at the time?"
"5","Those of us who were older, such as myself, remember making plans of where we would meet if the country was devastated. It was a strange time. One of the things we're trying to get a handle on is passion and power. What were the early things you were passionate about, that you were interested in?"
"6","This was when you were six, seven, eight years old at the time."
"7","This is great."
